this is basically HORSE the basketball game for iPad. Players take turns drawing things (using the iPad's multi-touch input) and imitating each other. But, the drawing is linked with time, so it becomes more of a 'monkey see monkey do' dance.

it's still a cool, simple fun idea!

this was also the first time I used HaxePunk and AIR. I believe I ran into problems of using the drawing class to draw primitives directly to iOS (OpenGL ES)... but I don't quite remember.
